To run this software, the user has to have an up to date version of the Java Runtime environment (JRE). 
As we know, Java is a portable programming language which can be run on multiple platforms as long as those platforms 
have the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which interfaces with the hardware and operating system on behalf of the software 
programme. The latest JRE can be downloaded on the Oracle website.

The spectrum analysis part of this software performs graph plotting. 
To achieve this, a standard plotting library was imported. 
Therefore, to run this software efficiently, the ‘Component_Toolbox_App.jar’ file must be run in a folder containing another folder 
called ‘lib’ which has the ‘jmathplot.jar’ library in it. See figure below for details


There is only one controller and model class serving all the views.
